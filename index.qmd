Hi, I’m Johanna Jansen! I’m an undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Statistics and Data Science. I love to do yoga, read books, and learn new things. Currently, I am a Data Writer for the Daily Nexus and an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for the UCSB Computer Science Department.
